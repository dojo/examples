> ### Hacker News Progressive Web Application written to the specifications from [hnpwa.com](https://hnpwa.com/)

### [Demo](https://dojo-2-hnpwa-d668d.firebaseapp.com/)

This codebase was created to demonstrate an application built with Dojo.

-   **Build Time Rendering**: Uses the `.dojorc` to configure static html and critical CSS injection at build time.
-   **Progress Web Application**: Uses the `.dojorc` to configure PWA capabilities such as manifests and service workers.
-   **Evergreen builds**: Generates application bundles using esmodules targeted for evergreen browser to produce main application bundle less than 20kb gzipped.
-   **Lazy Loading (Code Splitting)**: Automatically code splits for widgets/outlets or containers that are defined in an application registry using the dynamic `import` syntax.
