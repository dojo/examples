## Usage

Currently, the examples assume you have a version of NodeJS 6 or later installed globally and available on the command line.  Also, if you wish to see some of the examples, you will need a local web server installed.

First, clone the repository locally:

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/dojo/examples.git
```

Then change directory to the example you wish to work with and use npm to install the dependencies:

```sh
> cd todo-mvc
> npm install
```

If you don't have Grunt installed globally, you will need to do so:

```sh
> npm install -g grunt
```

To build a version of a web application you can access, the *default* task for Grunt will do so:

```sh
> grunt
```

Assuming that the root of this repository is available on your local web server under `/examples` then the
application should be available on [`http://localhost/examples/todo-mvc/_build/src/`](http://localhost/examples/todo-mvc/_build/src/) or [`http://localhost/examples/todo-mvc-kitchensink/_build/src/`](http://localhost/examples/todo-mvc-kitchensink/_build/src/)


### Deploying to gh-pages

Assuming that you are working on a clone of the repository on the branch that you would like to deploy (typically `master`)

This assumes that npm & typings & dojo-cli have been installed for the example applications.

```shell
./scripts/gh-pages-publish.sh
```

The latest version(s) will now be available [on github pages](https://dojo.github.io/examples).

## Features

There are currently three examples:

- [todo-mvc](./todo-mvc) - A reference implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) built with current beta1 versions of Dojo 2 packages.
